# Microservice Architecture

The system will consist of four backend services and one frontend, all containerized using Docker and orchestrated as
part of a DevOps deployment pipeline.

## Server

### Data Fetching Service

- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Fetches data daily from the official **Bundestag API**.
    - Stores structured plenary speech data in a **PostgreSQL** database.

### Browsing Service

- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Provides REST endpoints for the React-based frontend.
    - Serves aggregated and filtered data from the database to the frontend.

### Notification Service

- **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Sends **email notifications** to users who follow specific **politicians** or **topics**.
    - Monitors new speech data and triggers alerts based on user preferences.

### GenAI Service

- **Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Langchain
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Performs **Natural Language Processing** on plenary speeches.
    - Embeds speech data, election programs, and coalition agreements using **vector representations** (e.g., via
      `pgvector`).
    - Provides a **Recommendation and Comparison (RAC)** system to evaluate alignment between speeches and policy
      documents.
    - Offers APIs to other services to perform semantic search and similarity scoring.

### Persistence
-   **Tech Stack:** PostgreSQL with `pgvector` plugin
-   **Responsibilities:**
    -   Stores structured plenary speech data fetched by the Data Fetching Service.
    -   Persists vector embeddings generated by the NLP & Recommendation Service.
    -   Provides data storage and retrieval capabilities for all backend services.


## Client

- **Tech Stack:** React
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Provides an intuitive user interface to explore topics, view speech summaries, follow politicians or themes, and
      manage notifications.
    - Communicates with the backend via the API Gateway service.
