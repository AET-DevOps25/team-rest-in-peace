# Problem Statement

Many people want to stay informed about politics — not just during election season, but all year long. They care about key decisions, debates, and where parties stand. But with over 200 Bundestag sessions each year, each lasting hours and covering countless topics, it’s overwhelming. While these debates are public, few outside political or media circles have the time to follow them, and most people rely on news coverage, often missing direct insights.

Our project wants to change that. We will collect and organize Bundestag speeches and debates by political party, topic, and speaker — making the raw information more accessible and searchable. On top of that, we will use AI to generate clear, easy-to-read summaries and short versions of full sessions, individual speeches, or specific topics. To avoid overwhelming users, we’ll offer a personalized notification service where they can track keywords they care about and get brief AI-generated updates.

It’s a tool to help people easily access the political information and topics they care about.

### User Groups

The app is designed for a wide range of users:

- **General public** who want to stay informed without spending hours reading transcripts.
- **Students and researchers** who need reliable summaries of political debates.
- **Journalists and media professionals** who require fast access to relevant political discussions.
- **Advocacy groups and NGOs** who monitor specific topics in political discourse.

### Example Scenarios

1. Lena, a university student in Berlin, wants to follow climate debates in the Bundestag but has no time to watch or read long sessions.  
   She goes to the website and subscribes to the keyword _“climate.”_ A few days later, she receives an email notification with a short AI summary of the latest Bundestag debate including the keyword climate.

2. Thomas, a journalist in Hamburg, needs to track what different parties are saying about digitalization.  
   He logs into the website, filters recent speeches by political party and topic, and quickly reads them before his editorial meeting.

3. Sofia, a first-time voter in Munich, wants to understand the key positions of her favorite party before the election.  
   She visits the website, selects the party, and reads through the summarized highlights of recent speeches.
